To view the current PASL documentation, you can either view the
contents of README.md directly or render README.md to the format of
your choise using [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). For
example, to generate a PDF, run from the command line the following.

    pandoc README.md -o README.pdf
